## 🌟 About The Project

**SabotsyMarket** is an e-commerce application designed to bridge the gap between local farmers,and consumers. It provides a beautiful, intuitive, and responsive marketplace for discovering and purchasing local goods.

The entire application is built with a focus on clean architecture, scalability, and a high-quality user experience, making the codebase as impressive under the hood as it is on the screen.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Intuitive Product Discovery**: A seamless interface for customers to browse, search, and filter products.
- **Intelligent Search**: Misspelled an item? No problem. Our smart search, powered by the **Levenshtein distance algorithm**, provides typo-tolerant results to help users find exactly what they're looking for.
- **Producer Dashboards**: A dedicated space for producers to manage their product listings, track inventory, and view orders.
- **Modern, Responsive UI**: Crafted with **shadcn/ui**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** for a sleek, accessible, and animated user experience on any device.
- **Robust Architecture**: Built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with a clear separation of concerns (`domain`, `application`, `presentation`), and Dependency Injection with **InversifyJS** for a truly decoupled and testable codebase.
- **Advanced State Management**: Context API for state handling.
- **Seamless Cart & Checkout**: An easy-to-use shopping cart and a streamlined ordering process.
